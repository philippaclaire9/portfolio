        <h4>MovieMapStar</h4>
        <p>
          This was a group project with 3 other Northcoders students. The
          web-app allows users search movies to find their filming locations on
          a map and plan a route to multiple locations. Users are able to take
          photos of their trip and view them in the appâ€™s gallery. The user
          database was built through AWS with DynamoDB and the camera and
          gallery were built with Expo with the photos stored in S3 buckets. The
          map was built using Google Maps Javascript, Directions, Geolocation
          and Geocoding APIs. Requests were made to the IMDb API to access
          filming location information. Styling was completed with Material UI.
          The entire project was completed remotely.
